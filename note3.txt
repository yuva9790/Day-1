What is the need of an IP address versus a MAC address?

MAC address is an address that is assigned to your hardware that is used as a signature to make it stand out from the network hardware used by the rest of world. It is a 48 bit address and is fixed for your device.

Since it is device specific, it doesn`t represent any qualities of the network you are connected with. For instance, it carry no useful information about your geographical area, nearest node, etc.

A real life analogy will be like giving your house name to a foreigner and asking him to find your home. We can be almost certain that he will never find your house. This is because any feasible addressing system should be hierarchical in design. And MAC is not hierarchical in design neither is it meant to be.

MAC is used within a network to find the device to which the packet is to be forwarded. While IP is an hierarchical addressing system which is used by a distant node to locate the network to which its communicating node is located. So both addressing schemes are required and works in parallel to provide effective communication.
